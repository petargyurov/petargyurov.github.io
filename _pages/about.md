Hi, I'm Petar. I am a software developer based in London. I have some data science and machine learning experience. Trying to enter the conservation space.

When I'm not working I am day-dreaming of travelling the world and owning a little wood workshop. Currently trying to learn Spanish. For the 5<sup>th</sup> time.
