You go to the supermarket, you buy a can of sustainably sourced tuna, some organically grown veg and an all-natural smoothie.
You drive home in your eco-friendly Audi and a week later you recycle all your grocery packaging because the label said it can be recycled.
You feel good about yourself. 

Well, maybe you shouldn't.

***Note:** this is not an in-depth investigation into each label and its organisation. The governance structures of each of these certificate authorities is complex, nuanced and each deserves a blog post of its own. I am not an expert. I have glossed over a lot, both good and bad points.*

# The Green Dot

### What it looks like: 
> This product is recyclable and/or is made of recycled materials

### What it actually means:
> The company producing this product financially contributes to the cost of recovery and recycling of the materials used

People confuse [The Green Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Dot_(symbol)) for the *actual recycling symbol* (♻️) all the time. This little green dot actually means that the company in question pays a sum to the licensing authority in the country to support the "recovery and recycling" of the disposed packaging. The sum in question varies per country. 

# MSC Certification

### What it looks like: 
> This seafood is guaranteed to be sustainably sourced from an environmentally conscious fishery

### What it actually means:
> The MSC has sent an independent observer to the fishery, to observe its practices; if deemed to match their standards they charge a licensing fee for the use of this symbol

The [MSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Stewardship_Council) has been under critisism from environmental groups for a long time. Most recently, it was featured (and heavily critised) in the popular Netflix documentary "Seaspiracy". To summarise, the label has come under fire for giving the impression that particular fishing standards are met, when in reality it is close to impossible to monitor, enforce or even correctly assess a fishery's practices. The inherent conflict of interest is also worth mentioning, as the organisation receives a monetary incentive from issuing more of these licences.

# FSC Certification

### What it looks like:
> This product was made out of sustainably / eco-friendly sourced wood

### What is actually means:
> The company has paid for and received its FSC's certification after an independent body has deemed that is has met or has almost met the criteria; in the case of minor infractions, the certificate is still issued and a timeline for reconcilation is set.

FSC forest management certification confirms that the forest is being managed in a way that preserves biological diversity and benefits the lives of local people and workers, while ensuring it sustains economic viability.
