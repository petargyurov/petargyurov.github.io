In May 2021 we packed our bags and left for Costa Rica. Originally having planned to do this trip a few months earlier, we had already quit our jobs and were solely waiting for the COVID-19 restrictions to be lifted for international travellers _leaving_ the UK. A few stressful hours at the airport, one short layover in Madrid and 13 hours later we landed in San José, where our adventure begins.


# The route
We didn't have a pre-planned route. We had a list of destinations and landmarks that we wanted to visit so we had a rough idea of where we wanted to go. Below you can see what our route ended up looking like at the end of the trip.

San Jose → Puerto Viejo → La Fortuna → Monteverde → Quepos → Uvita → Puerto Jimenez → COPROT → Drake's Bay → Jaco → Santa Teresa → Samara → Tamarindo

*The red points are generally larger towns that we stayed in for longer; the blue are smaller ones that we either visited for a day or only stayed in briefly.*

# San José

The capital, located in the heart of the country, is unfortunately nothing to get excited about. Apart from the central market and a couple of above average buildings, there isn't much else. Having said that we decided to kill some time at the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum, which was very interesting and showed a lot about the roots of the country. The market, a maze of narrow alleys and stores full of souvenirs (and smelly agglomerations of meat and fish), was a bit disappointing. It was dark and cramped and made me feel a bit unsafe; the neighborhood is not a good one.

In fact, the most fun we had was away from the center - Barrio Escalante - streets filled with chic restaurants and bars, offering delicious but rather expensive food.

### COVID-19 in Costa Rica

In general, we did not have many problems entering the country. The country's GDP is heavily reliant on tourism, meaning tourists actually have more freedom than locals in some sense. Whilst no COVID test was required for entry, mandatory health insurance determined the length of your stay (max 90 days). Local vehicles were restricted to drive only on certain days based on their number plate, but rental cars and tourist buses were exempt. The biggest effect we felt was from the **nightly restrictions: all restaurants and stores had to close at 21:00.** It was not the end of the world but it meant that we could not enjoy different places fully. Masks were mandatory at all times.


# Puerto Viejo
This particular town is one of the hotspots on the country's Carribean coast. As a typical beach town with shops and restaurants connected by dirt roads, we came here with two goals: lie on the beach and drink piña coladas.

<br/>

Despite the obvious party vibe -- do expect to be offered drugs every time you're walking around, or even having dinner! -- the town still manages to remain somewhat charismatic. 

The town itself is quite small but it offers enough in terms of restaurants for the 4 or 5 days that we were there. You're likely to find a few more fish dishes here, alongside Costa Rica's staple foods, rice and beans. Plenty of shops too, though the clothing prices made my eyes water! 

I do recommend you either walk or hire a bicycle to Playa Cocles. This beach is much larger and the atmosphere is much calmer. You'll find a few bars and restaurants along the road there too.

## Cahuita

Puerto Viejo doesn't offer much beyond its beaches, so we did a day trip to Cahuita National Park. We took the bus there, for about ₡2000 each. The park entrance is a 10 minute walk from the bus terminal. Entrance to the park is free but you are encouraged to pay a donation.

*Despite its small size, Cahuita National Park has a range of spectacular terrains and views*

If you head here on a whim, like we did, you'll probably be arriving without a tour guide. Outside the park entrance you'll most likely be met by a friendly local who will offer you guide services. A couple of things to note: this type of guide will not be official (i.e.: they probably haven't gone through all the certifications required to be officially recognised as a guide in CR) and they may not have equipment with them. Nonetheless, we decided to hire one of these locals, after haggling and reducing the price significantly. If my memory serves me right, they initially wanted ₡50,000; we paid around ₡20,000 plus tips at the end.

We were met by a different man than the one who took our money: a frail yet jovial old man, with a large branch for a walking stick and the unmistakable smell of booze draped around him. He introduced himself as Ronald and he apologised, for he said he had one too many glasses of rum the night before. He explained that he has been a guide for over 30 years, that he grew up in the jungle.

*Ronald, at the end of the guided walk*

Ronald was very polite and eager to share his knowledge; he kept insisting we ask him questions! He told us a lot about the endemic fauna and flora, making a particular point about Costa Rica's rich supply of medicinal plants. Some of his claims about these plants sounded dubious but as a sign of respect we simply nodded along.

We were surprised that within two steps of walking into the park, Ronald told us to stop and look: he had spotted a lizard. Nearby he spotted a turtle. He said that normally there is also a crocodile that lounges around but he was nowhere to be found today. 

It is important to note that seeing wildlife in these parks is not guaranteed. That is the nature of... well, nature. Other than the limitless leaf-cutter ants marching alongside us and a sleepy sloth, we didn't notice much more in terms of wildlife along the *guided* part of the tour. You see, Ronald only walked with us for 1-2km -- the entire trail is around 8km -- we said our goodbyes, paid him a tip and carried on by ourselves.

I do recommend you get a guide, official or not, because they *will* the spot the wildlife. They know where and what to look for.

The 8km trail will take you through a variety of landscapes. You can take a break at a secluded beach that feels all yours, then head through into the deep jungle where you might get lucky and see some snakes. The trail does have large sections with no tree canopy, so it's recommended you bring some water. We heard from other tourists that park officials may require you to dispose of plastic bottles before entering, so if possible bring a reusable bottle to limit the chances of confiscation.

Cahuita National Park was an early highlight in our trip; I thoroughly recommend you go there if you are already in Puerto Viejo. 

One final note: the exit is right next to the bus stop. Busses come once every 1 hour and they are likely to be packed, which means they won't stop to pick you up. That happened to us and the other couple of tourists there, so we ended up calling a local taxi to come and pick us up. 

## Manzanillo

Another local delight is the small town of Manzanillo, south of Puerto Viejo. 

The journey there is worth doing by itself. A 1 hour bicycle ride will take you along a smooth paved road that undulates through the otherwise untamed jungle. As the sun's rays pierce the canopy, they also bring to attention the thousands of gigantic spider webs spluttered across the telephone wires. Howler monkeys can be heard wailing in the distance and if you're lucky you might see toucans fly between the trees.

*You can hire a squeaky retro bike like this one for about $7*

The town itself felt very quiet, with most shops and restaurants closed. There is a national park nearby, Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre Gandoca, but we were told that due to a recent storm the paths were extremely muddy and hiking was ill-advised.
