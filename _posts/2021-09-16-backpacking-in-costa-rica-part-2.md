After soaking in the sun and sea for a good few days, we rented a car and headed towards the northern central valley. This post will only focus on La Fortuna because there is so much to do here and in the surrounding area!

# La Fortuna
We arrived at our Airbnb, 5 minutes from the cente, after a ~5 hour drive from Puerto Viejo (which was mostly spent behind series of long lorries). It's not a large city, but in comparison to Puerto Viejo it could be considered big. The town center is surprsingly colourful and bustling, with a nicely maintained park nestled in the middle of the town's grid system. Around the park you will find a plethora of restaurants, bakeries, sodas (small local cafeterias/restaurants) and tour centers.

We had decided to rent a car for this part of the journey because the attractions were somewhat spread out. In retrospect, you could probably get away without one, but you'd have to organise transport to the national parks and whatnot via tour agencies, which also comes at a cost of course. 

## Night Walk

There is so much to do in La Fortuna: let's kick things off with a night walk in the jungle! As mentioned before, the town center is full of tour agencies all selling the same thing. We shopped around for the best price; outside Mercado de Artesanías, a large souvenir market, we found a man tending a small stall. He introduced himself as Sergio. We chatted for over 10 minutes; he was a very sweet, passionate man, who absolutely loved his community and the nature around it. Don't be fooled by this modest description of him -- he has been a guide for many years and has even done work with the BBC -- or so he tells us! In any case, we fell in love with his charisma and decided to do the night walk with him.

The advertised duration of the walk was around 2 hours -- lost in his passion, Sergio took us around the entire reserve, which took almost 4 hours! -- not that anyone is counting, but in total we saw about 9 sloths, various bugs, a racoon, a kinkajou, some common lizards and of course posion dart frogs.

I cannot stress the passion and knowledge that Sergio had for his surroundings. He was full of wild stories too. At one point he grabbed a millipede and demonstrated how they produce cyanide as a defense response, letting us get a whiff of the poisonous, yet aromatic gas!

If you ever find yourself here, find Sergio and tell him Petar and Jess sent you! ❤️

## Hot Springs
Heading north-west of the town along the main road you will find dozens of hot spring resorts, all varying in price and luxury. Fortunately you can also find free access to the very same hot river that the private resorts are built around. We were told where to go by our Airbnb host; we parked at the side of the road where we had to pay a small fee of ₡2000. We headed down a small path that leads you under the bridge ahead. When we reached the river we thought we were at the wrong place, since the underpass you have to traverse didn't inspire us imagery of relaxing hot springs!

*Beyond this tunnel lies paradise, trust me.*

Through the underpass we could see a stone wall on the other end, with warm steam rising through the lush greenery. We hopped over the stone wall and discovered the river opening up and a couple of early birds already soaking in the natural pools.

*Find a nice spot to nestle in; the current is actually quite strong!*

As the day went on, more and more locals and tourists began gathering for a chance to soak in the blissful stream, some even bringing half a fridge's worth of food and drink with them. I highly recommend you come here, and even if the rain starts pouring down, you won't mind it one single bit...

## Luxury Spa Resorts

As mentioned earlier, the area is full of high-end spa resorts. Enticed by the possibility of a moderately affordable spa break (we hadn't learned that Costa Rica is very expensive yet), we looked at staying one or two nights at the Baldi Hot Springs Resort. Much to our disappointment (but to the delight of our wallets), even a single night's stay here was way too much given our budget. We did however decide to buy the day-pass which gave us access to all the spa facilities and came with lunch included.

As the night grew, thunderstorms brought torrential rain down on us. Surrounded by hot steamy water, one could say that there were worse spots to be stuck at during a rainstorm! All in all, it was fun and relaxing day, and for about $60 it's not the worst deal in the world.

## Vólcan Arenal

<img src="/assets/images/costa-rica/fortuna-arenal-hike.jpg" />

The perfectly shaped cone is an unmissable sight in the skyline; for most of the time we were in La Fortuna it was unfortunately obscured by cloud near the rim. 
Driving west of the town will take you to the national park which contains a number of trails. We first drove to the Peninsula Sector. We bought our tickets there for about $15 each. The short, paved walk will take you to the edge of the peninsula jutting out into the lake, proving a... cloudy view of the volcano.

We also saw a rather brave white-nosed coati and a lot of large birds, including a number of great currasow hiding amongst the bushes.

This walk wasn't particularly long so we had plenty of time in the day to go and do another hike in the national park. We drove to the *other* visitor center; in total I belive there are 3 centers in close proximity to each other. We *didn't* do the "1968 Lava Trail", if that clears things up... 

<img src="/assets/images/costa-rica/fortuna-hike-map.png" /> *The entrances are a short drive from eachother. One ticket gets you into all of them.*

The hike to "Mirador Colada" is pretty easy, though it does take some time. The first part of the walk takes you through secondary forests: young trees and tall grass dominating the terrain. After sometime you enter the primary forest: untouched trees that have been growing for a very long time. We came across one of the most monumental trees I had ever seen (and I've seen Canada's Gnarliest Tree!).

<img src="/assets/images/costa-rica/fortuna-ceiba-tree-hike.jpg" /> | <img src="/assets/images/costa-rica/fortuna-ceiba-tree-hike-2.jpg" /> 

The images don't quite capture the true scale of this imposing Ceiba giant. Its circumeferece alone was something to gawk at. The sign posted nearby states that the tree is 30m tall and is estimated to be around 400 years old. If the twisted roots and vines don't add enough mystique to its character, we were later told by a guide in Monteverde that despite what the officials say about the age of the tree, it's only ~50 years old! He claimed that the 1968 eruption wiped out most of the trees in the area and after the natural process of soil enrichment (volcanic ash, lava, etc.) the tree grew at an accelerated rate. I wasn't able to find many sources about either estimate. Nonetheless, this was an awesome thing to see.

The end of the trail will lead you to a viewpoint near the base of the volcano, where you can see the igneous rock curled into knots from when it was still hot lava. 

## Rio Celeste

Not too far from La Fortuna is another wonderful site to explore, Rio Celeste. This river and waterfall are famous for their turqouise coloured water that almost appears to glow. I'd say this is a hike/walk you can do without a guide; it's quite a busy trail so the chances of spotting wildlife are low. 

Don't be disappointed if the colour isn't as impressive as the pictures in the brochures -- when we went the waterfall was kind of murky -- it changes depending on the weather and acidity levels of the two rivers that merge into Rio Celeste, under a process known as Mie Scattering.

Most people come here just for the waterfall, but there is a secret little spot outside the park that you can take a dip in. It's quite cold but in the afternoon heat it's exactly what you need. 
We actually saw a snake swimming upstream just as we were getting out of the water! Below is a still taken from a video we took but it's not very clear unfortunately -- I think it's most likely a Costa Rican Water Snake *(Hydromorphus concolor)*.

That was pretty much all of the action in La Fortuna, and that's without mentioning any of the restaurants or other activities we did in detail (like water rafting). 

Next up, Monteverde.
